    <h4>
        
        
        OverWatch Inc. is an organization which provides custom made and custom built actionable business intelligence for our clients based on the lawful collection, collation and analysis of publicly available information (Open Source Intelligence â€“ OSINT). We at OverWatch think that as the world is moving towards a more digital path and information is becoming more digitalized it is vital that our local community and Batswana have easy custom-made and tailored access to information on whatever topic of interest, published on the internet.
OSINT is the collection and analysis of information that is gathered from public, or open, sources.
